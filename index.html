            <h2 class="title is-4 mt-5">The Problem we are solving</h2>
            <p>
              We are living longer now than we ever have done. The average
              person in the United Kingdom is now living until 81, already 10
              years more than they were in 1970 (1). Despite this increase in
              lifespan, the average person has never spent so many years in poor
              health. In the UK, the average person spends 12 years of their
              life in poor health - almost 2 years longer than in 1990 (2).
            </p>
            <p>
              Clearly, there is a need for healthcare solutions that support
              older adults with living well and independently for longer, and
              which enable early detection of risks before they threaten
              long-term health.
            </p>
            <p>
              This project aims to prevent physical and cognitive decline,
              thereby increasing healthy lifespan and maintaining independence.
            </p>
            <p>
              Signs of physical decline can include loss of muscle mass, slower
              walking speed, and fatigue. However, we can prevent this and
              enable people to age healthily with appropriate interventions such
              as exercise, improved sleep, and increased social connection,
              especially if addressed early.
            </p>

            <h2 class="title is-4 mt-5">Our Solution</h2>
            <p>
              We are developing a platform and programme that older adults can
              use to monitor their own health at home and which will encourage
              them to adopt healthy behaviours. This consists of a selection of
              sensors, worn by people and placed around their home, and an
              accompanying user interface that will provide personalised
              feedback about their progress.
            </p>
            <p>
              We expect this system to support people to proactively manage
              their own health and independence, thereby improving health
              outcomes including frailty risk, quality of life and mental
              wellbeing. Furthermore, it could enable early detection of any
              deterioration through analysis of sensor data.
